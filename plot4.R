# Q4 
# Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related
# sources changed from 1999â€“2008?

# Answer
# The main difficulty here was to decide how to select data. I ended up looking
# for words "Coal" and "Comb" in every column of SCC data. If I will find those
# 2 words in any of the columns than I will include that SCC code into the data
# that I am plotting. 
# Plots are quite boring. The first plot is a main answer and it showes changes 
# in the Total Emission from Coal Combustion souces by year. 
# Second and third plot solidify the trend from the first plot with very similar 
# trend for Median and Mean values.

# Check various fields that might have words coal and comb in them. 
# Get a feel on how to get all data related to coal and combustion
str(SCC)
sapply(colnames(SCC), getSCC_Rows, "Coal", "Comb", FALSE)
# By doing this I just find out that the following columns have words 
# "Coal" and "Comb" in their values: $Short.Name, $EI.Sector, 
# and $SCC.Level.Four

# Get only those records from SCC that have words "Coal" and "Comb" 
# in at least one of those 3 fields
tmp1 <- getSCC_Rows("Short.Name", "Coal", "Comb")
tmp2 <- getSCC_Rows("EI.Sector", "Coal", "Comb")
tmp3 <- getSCC_Rows("SCC.Level.Four", "Coal", "Comb")
subsetSCC <- unique(rbind(tmp1, tmp2, tmp3))
colnames(subsetSCC) <- colnames(SCC)

# Now I will merger NEI data and subsetSCC data
mergedData <- merge(subsetSCC, NEI)

# start graphing
png(filename = "plot4.png", width = 600, height = 1800)
par(mfrow = c(3, 1))

# as in previous plots data are heavily skewed towards 0 value, so regular plot/
# boxplot poduce graphs that are very hard to interpret. Instead of doing regular
# graphs I want to show change in total, mean and median by year
mergedData <- group_by(mergedData, year)
mergeByYear <- summarize(mergedData, sumByYear = sum(Emissions, na.rm = TRUE),
                         meanByYear = mean(Emissions, na.rm = TRUE),
                         medianByYear = median(Emissions, na.rm = TRUE))
