# Intro #
This repo is an implementation of project 2 for Coursera JHU Exploratory Data Analysis class. You can find description of assignment [here](https://class.coursera.org/exdata-033/human_grading/view/courses/975128/assessments/4/submissions)

Data for the pjoject is available [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip)

There are six questions in the project. I need to create a separate R file with a name plotN.R that will create plotN.png file that will answer each question.

## Files ##
1. There are 6 R files: plotN.R
2. There is also Init.R file that is sourced from each of the PlotN.R files. It loads data, instals packages, defines functions that are used in more than one place.
3. There are 6 output files plotN.png
4. README.md file

##  Overall approach
Project assignment was to create one plot that will answer each question. I
choose "bluntly disregard" that task :). Feel free to deduct the points. But I
felt that it was also important to show the way I was approaching the data,
why I choose one way over another. I learned a lot of neet tricks in the
process and wanted to save them for myself as well as show them to the people
who will grade my project. In general the last graph will answer the question
at hand. I also will put comments in the code that will summarize fundings.
